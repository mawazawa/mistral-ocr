- Product / UX: add drag-and-drop with file
  validation, progress states, richer results (tables,
  key/value sections, download links), and persistent
  history per session.
  - Architecture: introduce an upload service that
  streams to object storage before OCR, add queue-
  based OCR workers for large documents, and implement
  structured logging + tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry)
  from the API route.
  - Platform & DevOps: wire CI (lint/test/build),
  set up Vercel environment separation, add secret
  rotation guidance, and enforce schema via zod
  parsing at request boundaries.
  - Testing: expand to integration tests that exercise
  the full client/server loop (Playwright), add
  contract tests against mocked Mistral responses,
  and capture negative scenarios (timeouts, malformed
  payloads).
  - Performance & Observability: implement incremental
  polling or WebSockets for job status, surface
  elapsed time metrics, and add client-side analytics/
  error reporting.

  Roadmap

  1. Foundation (weeks 1–2) – Harden API (api/
  ocr.ts:69) with input validation, file size limits,
  structured error responses, and observability; add
  file/type guards in the client before upload (src/
  App.tsx:51). Wire GitHub Actions for lint/test/
  build.
  2. Experience (weeks 3–5) – Introduce drag-and-
  drop uploader, progress indicators, authentication
  template, and richer results (tables, key-value
  grouping) with paging/filters drawing from src/
  lib/ocr.ts:17. Improve accessibility and mobile
  responsiveness.
  3. Scale & Insight (weeks 6–8) – Break OCR into
  async jobs backed by queue/storage, add document
  history and sharing, implement usage metrics
  dashboards, and integrate rate limiting plus secret
  rotation playbooks.
  4. World-Class Extras (weeks 9+) – Offer templated
  exports (JSON/CSV), multi-language UI, pluggable
  OCR/Q&A models, fine-grained permissions, and
  compliance features (redaction, audit trails, data
  retention controls).

  Executing this path elevates the playground from
  a demo-quality prototype to a robust, production-
  ready Document AI workstation with best-practice UX,
  reliability, and governance.
